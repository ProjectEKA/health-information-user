## :hospital: Health Information User

> "Health information User" refers to an entity that wishes to consume the
>  services of the Health Data Consent Manager and obtain aggregated health
>  information for providing services to the Customer.

## :muscle: Motivation

> The customer may designate an HIU as the recipient of the Health Information when
> requesting consent artifact creation to consent manager. The HIU needs to maintain the
> customerâ€™s health information provided to it securely in compliance with terms of the
> consent granted by the Customer.
